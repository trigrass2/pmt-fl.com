         Whether for air quality monitoring, safety or control, sensor applications have one common requirement: a reliable sensor component. ams’s ability to micro-machine sensor chips using standard silicon wafer technology allows it to produce consistently reliable sensors in high volumes for mass market applications. The AS-MLV-P2 are high-performance sensor components which are highly sensitive to VOCs and provide superior measurement of indoor air quality. The sensor applications are produced using a combination of thin-film, thick-film and other patent-pending proprietary technologies developed by ams. The components are available in a package which offers the ultimate in design efficiency.
