        <p class="intro"><br/>
        To detect indoor air quality, monitoring systems have traditionally measured a combination of temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Most consumers, however, evaluate air quality by the concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as smoke, cooking odors, bio-effluence, and pollutants coming in from outdoors, or from human action inside the building. The ams iAQ Indoor Air Quality modules are low-cost, ultra-compact solutions for the detection of poor air quality. The modules use micro-machined metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors to detect a broad range of VOCs while interacting directly with CO2 levels in the room.
