          The AS3560 and AS3561 are true ground headphone amplifiers using Class G and Class H topologies respectively. These products combine highest quality audio associated with traditional Class AB topology together with very low power consumption by modulating the power to the headphone amplifier according to needs. The Class G topology switches between 3 power rails, while the Class H adapts the power rail to whatever power is needed to drive the headphone volume. Both devices use differential line inputs to minimize the effects of ground noise and EMI susceptibility and output volume can be locally adjusted trough I2C.
