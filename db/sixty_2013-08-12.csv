I've just found your product and haven't had time to look through it too much but the TDC-GP2 and its associated upgrades look like the solution I need. 

 I don't know if you are continuing to make older chips like the TDC-GP2 available but if they are availible I could use some advice on the chip to use for a high resolution time difference between a GPS 1 pps and a 100MHz clock.

I need to get an idea of availability and pricing for 2 to 5 evaluation kits, GP22-EVA-KIT, and price breaks for 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000  chips, so I can get approval to buy some evaluation kits and for decision making.

We're in a second generation system prototype but we'd like to get to market quickly, like this time net year, so availability will become an issue.

"Gianluca Glazer","","818-538-5147","gglazer@reviewincus.com","Lack of reviews online hurting Professio","Hello Professional Medical Trnscrbng,

I ran a search on your business, and noticed it currently has very few customer reviews on sites such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, Citysearch, etc. Here is a link that shows you how your business shows up when a potential customer searches for your reviews: http://google.com/search?q=Professional+Medical+Trnscrbng+Spring+Hill%2c+FL+reviews 

Did you know 86% of consumers use online reviews as part of their buying process, and if you have NO RATINGS only 2% of consumers would be likely to do business with you. You could be losing customers to a competitor who has great reviews. 

At ReviewInc ( http://reviewincus.com ), our software makes it easy, affordable and effective to use real reviews to grow your business through over 120 review sites we work with.

Give me a call for a quick demo and I'd be happy to show you how it works.

Kind Regards,
